# FormBuilder 1.0 by Amit Turner for Wix 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.7.

## Run development server
First run 'node server.js' in the directory.
then run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
the mongoDB server is on the cloud (atlas mongoDB) so it will automatically connect, fetch and get info from it.

for any further question you can get me by email: amitur91@gmail.com
