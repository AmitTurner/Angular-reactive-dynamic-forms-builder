# FormBuilder 1.0 by Amit Turner for Wix 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.7.

## Run development server
you must have npm and node install on your computer.
download the src files.

- Go to the src directory from cmd console and type "npm install", wait for it to download all files needed. (this is not the production version so youll get more files than actually needed while live and running in a real site).
- Open another console window in the src dir, run 'node server.js' .. you will see "database connected" message.
- Open another console window in the src dir, run `ng serve` and wait for it to load for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and enjoy!

the mongoDB server is on the cloud (atlas mongoDB) so it will automatically connect, fetch and get info from it.

some code parts are marked off for future use. as it can still be improved.

*If you see the 'potential security vulnerability', please ignore it. it is a known problem in angular about to be fixed by them further in the future.
