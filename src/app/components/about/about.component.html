      <p>
        In order the build this project i had to learn Angular, node.js and mongo from scrach.
        I chose using this pack after reading online and deciding
         I will have the best result considering there are 2 weeks to learn the platform and to make the product.
      </p>
      <p>
           I tried giving the user a nice UX while making sure the server actions are clean, fast and as simple as possible. </p>
